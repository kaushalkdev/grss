# GRSS: A Grep Clone in Rust

This project aims to create a robust and efficient grep clone written entirely in Rust.  The goal is to provide a command-line tool that offers comparable functionality to the standard `grep` utility, while leveraging Rust's performance and safety features.

## Features

*   **Basic Grep Functionality:**  Search for patterns in files and standard input.


## Future Enhancements

*   **Support for more advanced regular expression features.**
*   **Improved performance for large files and directories.**
*   **Integration with other command-line tools.**
*   **Enhanced user interface and experience.**


## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:** `git clone <repository_url>`
2.  **Build the project:** `cargo build`
3.  **Run the program:** `cargo run <options> <pattern> <files>`
